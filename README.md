# ImageAI-Setup-Guide

This is a visual, step-by-step guide on how to set up ImageAI using Google's free service, Google Collab. This guide hopes to lower the barrier of entry and further democratise this technology for the general public.

## Step 1: Go to Google Collab (https://colab.research.google.com/)

-   You'll have to set up a Google account if you haven't already

## Step 2: Create a new notebook using this github

1. Within Google Collab, navigate to the 'Github' tab
2. Paste the following url into the text field:

https://github.com/slooi/ImageAI-Setup-Guide/blob/main/ImageAISetup.ipynb

## Step 4: Download Files

1. Run the first block of code by clicking the play button located on the left side of the code block (note this step will take between 4-7 minutes. Try running the block of code again if it doesn't finish within that time frame)
2. You will get a warning from google. Click 'Run anyway' to continue.
